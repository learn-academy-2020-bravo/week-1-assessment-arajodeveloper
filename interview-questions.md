# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: function takes arguments and returns what you expect when you call. It is reusable.

  Researched answer: A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.



2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Map returns the same length of the original array but filter can shrink or extends depending on your operations.

  Researched answer: The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
  The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.



3. what is the difference between console.log() and returns?

  Your answer: you can use multiple times of console.log() but return uses only once per function.

  Researched answer:return is used to get the out come of something (i.e function)
console.log() is used in to get the out put of a statement.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: argument is what you are passing into the function.

  Researched answer: arguments is an Array -like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Be patient and be respectful. Not everyone is at the same level and we all come from different background. The main key to do well in pair programming is to respect the other person's boundary. Driver is the person who write code and see what is ahead directly, and the navigator is the person who read the map and see the overall process.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: TDD stands for test driven development that you create the test case. Just like when new medicine is developed, it must be approved by proper organization that it is safe to use to people. The medicine is put to test multiple times until it proves its safety before introduced to people. TDD allows developers to see the code that it will work. Also, developer might not catch errors that they are not thinking of but it is possible.

  Researched answer: Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass. This is opposed to software development that allows code to be added that is not proven to meet requirements.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I think the lecture for each topic was very thorough. I find it helpful especially when the instructors give us complex examples adding to the basic concept. That helps to see the bigger picture of the concept.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React: React is a JavaScript library that specializes in helping developers build user interfaces, or UIs. In terms of websites and web applications, UIs are the collection of on-screen menus, search bars, buttons, and anything else someone interacts with to USE a website or app.
- Yarn: Yarn is a new package manager for Javascript that evolved from npm. Basically, it is a some kind of open source package that is developed by Exponent, Google, and Tilde. It utilizes to create optimal developing environment for the developers.
- React State:React components has a built-in state object.The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.When the state object changes, the component re-renders. The state object can contain as many properties as you like.
- CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. create or add new entries;
read, retrieve, search, or view existing entries;
update or edit existing entries;
- this: The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.
In a method, this refers to the owner object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.
